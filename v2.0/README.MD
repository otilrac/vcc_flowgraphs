# VCC Flowgraphs, Version 2.0

Significant development in this path.  lots of junk flowgraphs at the moment.  rearranging as follows:

* junk - junk flowgraphs that i don't want to delete yet.  also old reference stuff.
* hier - non-junk hierarchical blocks/flowgraphs.
* dev - development flowgraphs.  current, but not ready for 'flight' status yet.
* flight - flight ready flowgraphs <-- USE THESE FOR OPS WITH THE BIRD.
